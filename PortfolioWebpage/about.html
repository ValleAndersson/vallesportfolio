            <p>
                Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio! 
                
                My name is Valentin Andersson, and I am a Business Intelligence Developer with a passion for data visualization and reporting.
                I have a strong background in customer relations, having worked almost a decade in the service industry and retail. 
                My keen interest in how data can be used to drive business decisions and improve customer experiences put me on this path where I'm now looking for new opportunities to grow and learn.
                I am particularly interested in the intersection of data and user experience, and I strive to create reports and dashboards that are not only informative but also visually appealing and easy to use.
                If the reports we create are not user-friendly, they will not be used, and the data will not be utilized to its full potential.
                I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set, and I am excited to connect with others in the field of Business Intelligence.
                Feel free to browse my portfolio to see some of my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect.
                I am always open to discussing new projects, collaborations, or opportunities in the field of Business Intelligence.
