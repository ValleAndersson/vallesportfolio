This is my entire portfolio and its meant to contain projects i've worked on or are currently working on since starting my education. 

Most of my projects will be displayed via Github, a few select projects will be hosted on my webpage as well with a more in depth explanation regarding my process and thinking behind certain choices in regards to data cleaning or visual design.
